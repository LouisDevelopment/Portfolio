			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm Louis, a passionate programmer from Scotland. I've been 
				developing games and software for several years in my spare time, mostly for 
				personal use but I've also released a procedural noise generator, a game called Geometry Clicker and 
				a game called Freerunner.
				<br> <br>
				I'm currently in my fourth year studying Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh 
				which has so far been a great experience both academically and socially.
				<br> <br>
				I'm an extremely passionate programmer. I can currently write in C++, Java, Javascript
				, C#, HTML, CSS and a couple more. I'm always open to learning a new language, 
				whether it be for a job, university or out of personal interest.
