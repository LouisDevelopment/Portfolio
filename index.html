			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm Louis, a passionate programmer from Scotland. I've been 
				developing games and software for several years in my spare time, mostly for 
				personal use but I've also released a procedural noise generator, a game called Geometry Clicker and 
				a game called Freerunner.
				<br> <br>
				I'm currently in my second year studying Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh 
				which has so far been a great experience both academically and socially.
				<br> <br>
				I'm an extremely passionate programmer and I use any excuse to learn a new language. I can 
				currently write in Python, Javascript (with and without React), Java, C++, C#, HTML and CSS extremely well. I'm always open to 
				learning a new language, whether it be for a job or out of personal interest (or both).

			</p>
