        Draw Dojo was a social media platform developed using Typescript, React, MongoDB etc. and was similar to twitter, but
        rather than typing your posts you drew them! The project is unfortunately no longer
        available online, but I have kept the company website up which you can view below. <br>
        <a href="https://louisdevelopment.github.io/DrawDojo/" class="title">Company Website</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Draw Dojo project had a fully implemented canvas with different colours, brushes and
        tools, and was focused on the idea of "mashups", where multiple users could share a canvas
         and collaborate on a drawing. It was home to a live-updating feed on which a user could leave likes and comments. The
        feed would be continually populated for the user as new posts came through. Another
        feature was the mash-up feature. This allowed users to take another user's drawing and
        add to it and then post it themselves, tagging the original poster. Other features included:
        collaborative canvases, customizable profile pages and a robust log-in page.

        <p>A survival game built within Java using the LWJGL and JOML libraries. 
          This game includes crafting, building, mining,  procedurally generated 2D landscapes and caves 
          using Simplex Noise and unique biomes including plains, forests and deserts.
          This was my first attempt at a "complete" project when I was 16 but it eventually
          became too big of a project for me to handle at that time. I'd love to go back to it
          one day, every time I go back and run the game I see all the potential it has.

          <p>This online multiplayer game was created using HTML, CSS, JS and node.js as a university project 
            and is similar to the popular online games agar.io and slither.io, but with unique skii-like controls. 
            The source code, along with a readme 
            can be found on <a href="https://github.com/OllieBechstein/f28wp_Coursework" class="title">github</a>.

        <p>This project was created initially as my Advanced-Higher Computer Science Project and then 
          reworked at several points over the next year or two. It uses the same algorithm found in the 
          survival game for terrain generation. There are several things the user can adjust to get the exact generation you want.
          The project can be downloaded from

        <p>A physics tech demo made in C++, inspired by my partner's squishmallow aptly named "Squishy". In the tech demo you can throw Squishy around and he'll
          satisfyingly bounce around the room and chase balls around the room that you can also throw/ When I have more time I hope to return
          to this project and make it into the full experience I describe on the <a href="https://louis-braidwood.itch.io/squishy" class="title">itch.io</a> page.

        <p>This game was made in a 12 hour game jam. Its a simple clicker 
          game but is really fun and honestly quite addictive. Its great for
           passing the time. It can be downloaded at 
           <a href="https://louis-braidwood.itch.io/geometry-clicker" class="title">itch.io</a>.
