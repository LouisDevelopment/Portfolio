                <h2>Squishy Tech Demo</h2>
                <img src="images/squishyimg.png" alt="soft-body engine">
                <p>This 2D tech demo showcases a soft-body character and some balls you can throw around and play with. Its an early showcase of a game I am working on. It can be downloaded at <a href="https://louis-braidwood.itch.io/squishy">louis-braidwood.itch.io</a>, the github link can also be found on that page</p>
                <h2>Survival Platformer</h2>
                <img src="images/SurvivalGameImg.png" alt="Survival">
                <p>This game is something I worked on for a few weeks, it has building, crafting, mining, procedurally generated levels and caves. I wanted to continue with it for a year or so, but University was more important at the time so I stopped development. I may return to it one day, but for now the source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/LouisDevelopment/SurvivalPlatformer">github</a>.</p>
                <h2>Procedural Generator</h2>
                <img src="images/proceduralGenerator.png" alt="Perlin noise procedural generator">
                <p>This piece of software takes in several values from the user, and uses those values to create a unique noise-map. It was created for my Advanced Higher CS project but I've since used it for generating levels in games. It can be downloaded at <a href="https://louis-braidwood.itch.io/simplex-noise">louis-braidwood.itch.io</a>.</p>
                <h2>Geometry Clicker</h2>
                <img src="images/clicker.png" alt="Geometry Clicker">
                <p>This game was made in 12 hours and is probably the project I'm most proud of. Its a simple clicker game but is really fun for passing the time. It can be downloaded at <a href="https://louis-braidwood.itch.io/geometry-clicker">louis-braidwood.itch.io</a>.</p>
               <h2>MMO IO Game</h2>
                <img src="images/onlineIOGame.png" alt="IO Game">
                <p>This multiplayer game was created as a 2nd year computer science project and is similar to the popular online games agar.io and slither.io. The source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/OllieBechstein/f28wp_Coursework">github</a>. (I got an A)</p>
                <h2>Freerunner</h2>
                <img src="images/freerunner.png" alt="Freerunner">
                <p>This simple game was made in 10 hours as a personal challenge in Java.  It's extremely basic but addictivly fun.  Not perfect, since I only worked on it for the 10 hours I allowed myself, but its still something I'm glad I made. It can be downloaded at <a href="https://louis-braidwood.itch.io/freerunner">louis-braidwood.itch.io</a>.</p>
                <h2>3D Engine</h2>
                <img src="images/3dOpenGl.png" alt="3D opengl world">
                <p>I made this 3D world when I was learning C++ and OpenGL. It has a few interesting features such as blinn-phong lighting, specular water, particles and a procedural world created using Simplex Noise.</p>
