			<h3>Projects</h3>
            <section class = "featureBox">
                <h2>Procedural Generator</h2>
                <img src="images/proceduralGenerator.png" alt="Perlin noise procedural generator">
                <p>This piece of software takes in several values from the user, and uses those values to create a unique noise-map. It was created for my Advanced Higher CS project but I've since used it for generating levels in games. It can be downloaded at <a href="https://louis-braidwood.itch.io/simplex-noise">louis-braidwood.itch.io</a>.</p>
                <h2>Geometry Clicker</h2>
                <img src="images/clicker.png" alt="Geometry Clicker">
                <p>This game was made in 12 hours and is probably the project I'm most proud of. Its a simple clicker game but is really fun for passing the time. It can be downloaded at <a href="https://louis-braidwood.itch.io/geometry-clicker">louis-braidwood.itch.io</a>.</p>
                <h2>RPG Engine</h2>
                <img src="images/rpg.png" alt="rpg engine">
                <p>This 2D game Engine is built up of several system's I've developed.  Some of these include - NPC interations, advanced lighting, inventory, animation and a level editor.  I come back to it every so often to add new things and may release it some day.</p>
                <h2>3D Engine</h2>
                <img src="images/3dOpenGl.png" alt="3D opengl world">
                <p>I made this 3D world when I was learning OpenGL.  The art is out-dated but it has some interesting features, such as blinn-phong lighting, specular water, particles and a procedural world created using Simplex Noise. I'll likely expand upon it and release a game using it in the future.</p>
                <h2>MMO IO Game</h2>
                <img src="images/onlineIOGame.png" alt="IO Game">
                <p id = "final">This online game was created as a 2nd year computer science project and is similar to the popular online games agar.io and slither.io. (I got an A)</p>
                <h2>Freerunner</h2>
                <img src="images/freerunner.png" alt="Freerunner">
                <p id = "final">This simple game was made in 10 hours as a personal challenge.  It's extremely basic but addictivly fun.  Not perfect, since I only worked on it for the 10 hours I allowed myself, but its still something I'm glad I made. It can be downloaded at <a href="https://louis-braidwood.itch.io/freerunner">louis-braidwood.itch.io</a>.</p>
