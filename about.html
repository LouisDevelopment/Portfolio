      <h2><a class="title">Bio</a></h2>
      <p>I'm Louis, a passionate programmer from Scotland. I've been developing games and software 
        for several years in my spare time, mostly for personal use but I've also released a procedural noise generator, a game called Geometry Clicker and a game called Freerunner.
        I recently graduated with honours from the Computer Science course at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh which was a great experience both academically and socially.
